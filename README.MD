 Day 1 – Project Setup
Today, I began developing a web platform inspired by Airbnb. Here's what I completed:

✅ Basic project setup (Node.js, Express, folder structure)

✅ MongoDB connection using Mongoose

✅ Created Mongoose schema/model for property listings (Visiting)

✅ Designed and connected a new Express server

✅ Prepared sample data for initial listings

✅ Wrote seed script to initialize the database with sample data

✅ Tested MongoDB insertions and connections successfully
